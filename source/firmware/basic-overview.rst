.. attention::
    We are migrating to our own **Visual Studio Code extension** and a **portable version of Visual Studio Code**. For more information on how to install and use it visit
    :doc:`Developement with HARDWARIO Code <hardwario-code-installation>`.


This section will go over basic firmware development.

After a first few of the next chapters you will be able to **build**, **upload** and **debug** your firmware on our :doc:`Core Module <../hardware/about-core-module>`.

.. tip::

    | If you just want to flash some already existing firmware we encourage you to use the :doc:`HARDWARIO Playground <../basics/hardwario-playground>`.
    | It is more simple GUI tool that you can work with.

*********************
Firmware developement
*********************

In case you want to develop or update some existing firmware you can do it after some minor setup.
This setup along with some first few steps in firmware development is documented in next chapters.

.. note::

    To start with the setup you should go to the :doc:`HARDWARIO CODE Installation chapter <hardwario-code-installation>` and you will be guided from there.

    At the end of each chapter you will be referred to the next one.
