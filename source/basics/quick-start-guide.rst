#################

The goal of this **Quick Start Guide** is to show the basics in a few simple steps.

After this tutorial you will be able to build your device, flash firmware into it and get the data into your computer.

.. tip::

    This tutorial works with `Starter Kit <https://shop.hardwario.com/starter-kit/>`_.
    It is the easiest way to start with the HARDWARIO TOWER.

    Of course, you can do it with every other kit, you will just have to do a few more steps.

.. HARDWARIO TOWER is not just about the hardware but it comes with full documentation, tutorials,
.. software tools and most importantly - it comes with the extensive **technical support**.
.. HARDWARIO doesn't hesitate to use one of these channels In case you run in troubles or if anything is not clear to you:

.. - Write us an email to ask@hardwario.com
